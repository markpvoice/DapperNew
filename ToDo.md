### ✅ **Previous Session Completions (August 29, 2025 - Fast Refresh & Navigation Issue Resolution)**
- ✅ **Fast Refresh Navigation Bug Fixed**:
  - ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Admin navigation requiring double-clicks was caused by Fast Refresh full reload conflicts
    - **Issue**: Hooks mixing React components and TypeScript interfaces caused Fast Refresh to perform full page reloads
    - **Affected Files**: useAuth.ts, useBookings.ts, useDashboardData.ts exporting both hooks and interfaces
    - **User Impact**: First click triggered page reload, second click actually navigated to page
    - **Browser Console**: "Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload" warnings appeared consistently
  - ✅ **Type Separation Architecture**: Implemented clean separation of concerns for Fast Refresh compatibility
    - **Created**: `/src/types/auth.ts`, `/src/types/booking.ts`, `/src/types/dashboard.ts` for all TypeScript interfaces
    - **Updated**: All hooks now only export React hooks, import types using `import type` syntax
    - **Pattern**: Separated React components from non-React exports to prevent HMR conflicts
    - **Result**: Single-click navigation working correctly, no more Fast Refresh warnings

- ✅ **Enhanced Next.js Development Configuration**:
  - ✅ **Webpack HMR Stability Improvements**: Enhanced development server configuration for better reliability
    - **Added**: Webpack watch options with polling mode (1000ms) for reliable file change detection
    - **Configured**: Aggregation timeout (300ms) to prevent rapid rebuild conflicts
    - **Optimized**: Node modules ignored for better performance and stability
    - **Impact**: Smoother development experience with fewer WebSocket connection issues
  - ✅ **WebSocket Connection Stability**: Improved Hot Module Replacement connection management
    - **Before**: Frequent "WebSocket connection failed due to suspension" errors
    - **After**: Stable WebSocket connections with better reconnection handling
    - **Configuration**: Polling mode provides more reliable change detection than file system events

- ✅ **Development Experience Improvements**:
  - ✅ **Admin Navigation UX**: Calendar and Analytics tabs now load immediately on first click
  - ✅ **Clean Development Console**: No more Fast Refresh warnings cluttering console output
  - ✅ **Stable Hot Reloading**: Changes reflect immediately without full page reloads
  - ✅ **Better Error Reporting**: Clear separation of concerns improves TypeScript error messages

### ✅ **Previous Session Completions (August 29, 2025 - Critical Production Bug Fixes & Documentation)**
- ✅ **Critical File System Compatibility Fix**
  - ✅ **Button Component Import Bug Resolved**: Fixed case-sensitive file system issue blocking production builds
    - **Issue**: Imports using `'@/components/ui/button'` but file named `Button.tsx` caused TypeScript compilation failures
    - **Files Fixed**: MultiStepBookingForm.tsx and button.test.tsx import statements updated
    - **Solution**: Updated all imports to match exact file names: `'@/components/ui/Button'`
    - **Impact**: Production build now compiles without file system case conflicts, deployment ready
  - ✅ **Enhanced Button Accessibility**: Added comprehensive keyboard navigation support
    - **Feature**: Enter and Space key support with proper event handling and prevention of default behavior
    - **Accessibility**: Tab index management for disabled states (-1 when disabled, 0 when enabled)
    - **Implementation**: Custom onKeyDown handler with event propagation and accessibility compliance

- ✅ **Memory Leak Prevention & Database Connection Optimization**
  - ✅ **Event Listener Memory Leak Fixed**: Resolved MaxListenersExceededWarning in database connections
    - **Issue**: Multiple imports of db.ts were each registering SIGINT/SIGTERM listeners causing memory warnings
    - **Root Cause**: No singleton pattern for process event listeners, each import added new listeners
    - **Solution**: Implemented `listenersRegistered` flag and increased `process.setMaxListeners(20)`
    - **Result**: Clean process management with graceful database shutdown, no memory leak warnings
  - ✅ **Enhanced Database Shutdown Handling**: Comprehensive cleanup on process termination
    - **Features**: Graceful shutdown for SIGINT, SIGTERM, uncaughtException, unhandledRejection
    - **Error Recovery**: Proper error handling during database disconnection with console logging
    - **Process Safety**: Guaranteed clean exit without hanging database connections

- ✅ **Production Email Configuration Documentation**
  - ✅ **Email Service Deployment Requirements**: Documented production readiness blockers and configuration needs
    - **Current State**: Resend API in sandbox mode limited to verified development email addresses
    - **Production Requirements**: Domain verification at resend.com/domains required before live deployment
    - **Environment Variable**: FROM_EMAIL needs production domain update (currently using development email)
    - **Testing Limitation**: Customer booking confirmation emails will fail until domain verification complete
    - **Action Required**: Domain verification setup and environment variable update before production deployment
    - **Development Safe**: Current sandbox mode prevents accidental emails during testing phase

## 🚨 **MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW REMINDER**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: For ANY new task or feature request, the following workflow MUST be followed:**

### 📋 **Step 1: Task Planning (REQUIRED)**
- **Create TodoWrite list**: Break down task into specific, actionable items
- **Review documentation**: Read existing code patterns and architecture
- **Verify environment**: Ensure local dev server and database are running

### 🧪 **Step 2: Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)**
- **Write tests first**: Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **No code without tests**: Every feature must have corresponding tests
- **Run tests frequently**: Use `npm run test:watch` during development

### 🔧 **Step 3: Code Quality (ZERO TOLERANCE)**
- **Lint before commit**: `npm run lint` must pass with 0 errors/warnings
- **Format code**: `npm run format` must be run on all files
- **TypeScript compliance**: `npm run typecheck` must pass
- **Build verification**: `npm run build` must succeed

### 🧪 **Step 4: Local Testing (REQUIRED)**
- **Manual testing**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and test features
- **Database verification**: Check operations in Prisma Studio
- **Error checking**: Review browser console for any errors
- **Mobile testing**: Verify responsive design works

### 📝 **Step 5: Documentation (MANDATORY)**
- **Update CLAUDE.md**: Add implementation details and patterns
- **Update ToDo.md**: Mark completed tasks, add follow-up items
- **Update API docs**: If API changes were made
- **Code comments**: Add JSDoc for complex functions

### ✅ **Task Complete Criteria**
A task is NOT complete until ALL of these are true:
- ✅ Todo list shows all items completed
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm run test`)
- ✅ Zero linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (`npm run typecheck`)
- ✅ Application builds (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Local app runs correctly (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Database operations work (tested in Prisma Studio)
- ✅ Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md, ToDo.md)
- ✅ Changes committed to git

**🚀 This workflow ensures consistent quality and prevents technical debt.**
