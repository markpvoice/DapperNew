## 🚨 **MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW REMINDER**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: For ANY new task or feature request, the following workflow MUST be followed:**

### 📋 **Step 1: Task Planning (REQUIRED)**
- **Create TodoWrite list**: Break down task into specific, actionable items
- **Review documentation**: Read existing code patterns and architecture
- **Verify environment**: Ensure local dev server and database are running

### 🧪 **Step 2: Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)**
- **Write tests first**: Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **No code without tests**: Every feature must have corresponding tests
- **Run tests frequently**: Use `npm run test:watch` during development

### 🔧 **Step 3: Code Quality (ZERO TOLERANCE)**
- **Lint before commit**: `npm run lint` must pass with 0 errors/warnings
- **Format code**: `npm run format` must be run on all files
- **TypeScript compliance**: `npm run typecheck` must pass
- **Build verification**: `npm run build` must succeed

### 🧪 **Step 4: Local Testing (REQUIRED)**
- **Manual testing**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and test features
- **Database verification**: Check operations in Prisma Studio
- **Error checking**: Review browser console for any errors
- **Mobile testing**: Verify responsive design works

### 📝 **Step 5: Documentation (MANDATORY)**
- **Update CLAUDE.md**: Add implementation details and patterns
- **Update ToDo.md**: Mark completed tasks, add follow-up items
- **Update API docs**: If API changes were made
- **Code comments**: Add JSDoc for complex functions

### ✅ **Task Complete Criteria**
A task is NOT complete until ALL of these are true:
- ✅ Todo list shows all items completed
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm run test`)
- ✅ Zero linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (`npm run typecheck`)
- ✅ Application builds (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Local app runs correctly (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Database operations work (tested in Prisma Studio)
- ✅ Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md, ToDo.md)
- ✅ Changes committed to git

**🚀 This workflow ensures consistent quality and prevents technical debt.**
